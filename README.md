# monkey-rust
Monkey is a programming language from the (amazing) book _Writing An Interpreter In Go_, by Thorsten Ball. Like [many have done before](https://github.com/search?q=monkey+rust), this is my attempt at implementing the interpreter in Rust.

I'm mostly doing this for fun, but also to learn more about the inner workings of programming languages. If you share my interest, you should consider [buying the book](https://interpreterbook.com), and following along yourself!
